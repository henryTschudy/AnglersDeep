The interior of the mandrake fish's throat sports structures that could be analogous to vocal chords, but again, they seem insufficient to support the actual sounds it produces. Additionally, the fish's shrieks may have some mind-altering properties. I keep hearing the sound for hours, even once the fish has been disposed of.",
