The interior of the mandrake fish's throat sports structures that could be analogous to vocal chords, but again, they seem insufficient to support the actual sounds it produces.

The jealous fish's nematocysts (stinging cells) release an unidentified neurotoxin, which has been found to cause a mild emotional response in humans.
